# lsw-slackbot
A Slack bot for sending updates to the LSW Slack about current server status.

It's powered by the AsyncWebClient in the Python Slack SDK, and will asynchronously wait for user input and send responses as needed.

**Requires Python 3.7+ (recommended: 3.9.7),** else the async functionality **will not work!**
